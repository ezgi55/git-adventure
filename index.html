    <h1>Git Quiz</h1>
    <h4>What is Git and why is it so important?</h4>
        <p>Git is the most commonly used version control system.
            <br>Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to.
            <br>Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.
        </p>
    <h4>What’s a branch and why do we create them?</h4>
        <p>A branch is like a parallel world where you can create commit without introducing bugs into production code.<br>You can always fix the bugs before merging your branch into the production code.</p>
    <h4>What’s the working tree?</h4>
        <p>Your working tree is what is actually in the files that you are currently working on.<br>HEAD is a pointer to the branch or commit that you last checked out, and which will be the parent of a new commit if you make it.... git add will add or update files from the working tree into your index</p> 
    <h4>What’s the staging area?</h4>
        <p>The working area is where files that are not handled by git.<br>Hese files are also referred to as "untracked files.<br>Taging area is files that are going to be a part of the next commit, which lets git know what changes in the file are going to occur for the next commit.</p>
    <h4>What’s the command to retrieve the latest version of your files from the remote serve?</h4>
        <p>Git pull origin main</p>
